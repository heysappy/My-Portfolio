# My-Portfolio
Hi! Welcome to My-Portfolio!  I'm a university student (B3) from Japan. My major is Mechanical Engineering.
## Full-stack Robotics Engineer
I'm currently doing a long-term internship in robotics engineering.
Here are some projects I've worked on or am currently involved in:

・Migrated a real-world robotic system from **ROS1 (Noetic) to ROS2 (Jazzy)**  
・Created algorithms for **optimal path planning**  
・Designed and built custom hardware for the tool using **CAD and 3D printing**  
・Developing a diagnostic **GUI tool** using **Qt on Raspberry Pi**  
・Worked with **C++** and embedded **Linux** in a production environment  

These experiences gave me hands-on knowledge of full-stack robotics development.
